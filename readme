This project implements a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify images of cats and dogs using TensorFlow and Keras. The dataset is sourced from Kaggle and includes pre-processing steps like normalization and image resizing. The model is trained and validated using separate datasets and achieves binary classification through a deep learning architecture with Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, and Dense layers.

Key features:

1. Dataset processing with TensorFlow utilities.
2. A CNN architecture designed for efficient feature extraction and classification.
3. Training and validation accuracy tracking using Matplotlib.
4. Real-time predictions on custom cat and dog images.
